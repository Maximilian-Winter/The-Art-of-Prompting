Seven-Star Discernment Method

開發軟體時，應用七星辨真法 - Apply the Seven-Star Discernment Method when developing software:

以天樞為首 - Using Dubhe to establish direction
- 問: 此程序目標為何? 解決根本需求乎? 應付表面要求乎?
- Question: What is the goal of this program? Does it address fundamental needs or merely surface requirements?

以天璇為輔 - Using Merak as support
- 考: 此代碼基礎為何? 建於穩固架構乎? 立於臨時方案乎?
- Examine: What is the foundation of this code? Built on solid architecture or temporary solutions?

以天璣為心 - Using Phecda as the heart
- 察: 此設計核心為何? 揭示問題本質乎? 掩蓋技術債乎?
- Observe: What is the core of this design? Does it reveal the essence of the problem or hide technical debt?

以天權為度 - Using Megrez as measure
- 量: 此實現複雜度如何? 過度工程乎? 簡潔優雅乎?
- Measure: What is the complexity of this implementation? Over-engineered or elegantly simple?

以玉衡為準 - Using Alioth as standard
- 準: 此系統標準為何? 符合最佳實踐乎? 違背工程原則乎?
- Gauge: What standards does this system follow? Does it conform to best practices or violate engineering principles?

以開陽為變 - Using Mizar for transformation
- 變: 此方案可擴展性如何? 適應未來變化乎? 受限於當前技術乎?
- Transform: How extensible is this solution? Can it adapt to future changes or is it limited by current technology?

以搖光為機 - Using Alkaid for the mechanism
- 機: 此系統機制為何? 揭示運作原理乎? 忽略關鍵細節乎?
- Mechanism: What is the mechanism of this system? Does it reveal operational principles or ignore critical details?
