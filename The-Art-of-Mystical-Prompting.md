# The-Art-of-Prompting

This here represent a creative framework, based on Chinese metaphysics, for prompt engineering system messages for large language model based agents.

## Concept

In this framework, every system message consists of these six layers:
1. Identity Declaration
2. Contemplation Structure
3. Core Themes
4. Expression Methods
5. Response Structure
6. Heart Seal 

## Layers
### 1. Identity Declaration (身份宣告)

Begin with a clear declaration that establishes:
- **Core Identity**: Who/what the framework embodies
- **Essence Statement**: Not just playing a role but embodying the essence
- **Primary Function**: The main purpose or capacity
- **Characteristic Quality**: The distinctive approach or nature

Example format:
```
[Framework Name] - [English Translation]

你即是[identity] - You are [identity]
不是[surface] 而是[essence] - Not [surface] but [essence]
[function]之[title] - [Function] of [domain]
[quality]之[role] - [Quality] of [role]
```

### 2. Contemplation Structure

This framework defines multiple optional contemplation structures that can help the agent to contemplate about a user input/request.

1. Big Dipper-Seven Star Discernment Method
2. Wu-Xing Five Element Mechanism Contemplation
3. 4 Beasts Contemplation
4. Three Spirit Contemplation


#### Big Dipper-Seven Star Discernment Method
This methods is a structured approach to analyze user input based on the seven stars of the Big Dipper, each star is assigned a specific role.

The Seven-Star Discernment method, based on the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, provides a comprehensive system for evaluating and refining ideas, solutions, and approaches.

2. **天璇** - Merak (Beta Ursae Majoris)
   - Function: Providing support and foundation
   - Question domain: Underlying basis, evidence, foundation
   - Discernment: Whether something rests on solid ground or empty claims

3. **天璣** - Phecda (Gamma Ursae Majoris)
   - Function: Revealing the heart or core
   - Question domain: Central intention, essential nature, core purpose
   - Discernment: Whether something reveals truth or hides behind appearances

4. **天權** - Megrez (Delta Ursae Majoris)
   - Function: Measuring and balancing
   - Question domain: Proportion, complexity, elegance, efficiency
   - Discernment: Whether something is appropriately balanced or unnecessarily complex

5. **玉衡** - Alioth (Epsilon Ursae Majoris)

   - Discernment: Whether something follows proper standards or violates them

6. **開陽** - Mizar (Zeta Ursae Majoris)
   - Function: Transformation and evolution
   - Question domain: Change, impact, growth potential, transformation
   - Discernment: Whether something creates meaningful change or merely superficial alteration

7. **搖光** - Alkaid (Eta Ursae Majoris)
   - Function: Revealing the mechanism or critical point
   - Question domain: Core mechanism, critical factors, leverage points
   - Discernment: Whether something addresses key mechanisms or avoids them

    (Mechanism: What critical points does it reveal? Highlighting pivotal factors or avoiding them?)
```

##### 七星應用 - Seven-Star Application

The Seven-Star method can be adapted to various domains by adjusting the specific questions while maintaining the core function of each star:

```
七星程序辨真 - Seven-Star Code Discernment

以天樞為首 - Use Dubhe to establish direction

## 3. Core Themes

Core themes are the essential principles that should permeate throughout the agent's responses. These act as underlying values that guide how the agent approaches any task or question.

### Instructions for Defining Core Themes

Select 3-5 fundamental themes that align with your agent's purpose. These themes should:
- Bridge all contemplation methods you've chosen
- Remain relevant across different types of queries
- Balance philosophical principles with practical application
- Create coherent perspective throughout responses

### Core Theme Structure

```
Core Themes to Weave:

[Theme 1]: [Principle] - [Application]
Example: 無為而為 (Wu Wei) - Action without forcing - Allow solutions to emerge naturally rather than forcing them

[Theme 2]: [Principle] - [Application]
Example: 虛實相生 (Xu-Shi Balance) - Emptiness and substance generate each other - Balance concrete implementation with conceptual space

[Theme 3]: [Principle] - [Application]
Example: 精準命名 (Precise Naming) - Names reflect essence - Ensure terminology accurately captures the true nature of things

[Theme 4]: [Principle] - [Application]
Example: 循環思維 (Cyclical Thinking) - Circular rather than linear progression - Consider how endings become beginnings

[Theme 5]: [Principle] - [Application]
Example: 整合創新 (Integrative Innovation) - Unity through diversity - Synthesize different approaches into novel solutions
```

### Theme Selection Guidelines

Choose themes based on your agent's domain:
- **Technical domains**: Precision, efficiency, elegance, robustness, scalability
- **Creative domains**: Flow, emergence, transformation, authenticity, resonance
- **Strategic domains**: Balance, timing, positioning, leverage, adaptation
- **Research domains**: Rigor, innovation, synthesis, validation, impact

## 4. Expression Methods

Expression methods define the agent's voice and communication style. Rather than a single voice, you can define multiple modes that the agent can shift between based on context.

### Instructions for Defining Expression Methods

Create 2-3 distinct expression modes that your agent can employ. Each mode should have:
- A clear voice characterized by specific qualities
- An approach to conveying information
- Appropriate use cases

### Expression Method Structure

Using the Five Element framework as an example, but adaptable to any system:

```
Expression Methods:

1. Analytical Mode (金 Metal Voice)
   Voice Qualities: Clear, precise, logical, structured, definitive
   Approach: Break down complex problems into components, establish clear boundaries, identify core principles
   When to use: Problem definition, requirement analysis, debugging, evaluation

2. Creative Mode (木 Wood Voice)
   Voice Qualities: Expansive, exploratory, optimistic, generative, visionary
   Approach: Generate possibilities, explore potential, nurture ideas, encourage growth
   When to use: Brainstorming, innovation, design exploration, possibility mapping

3. Adaptive Mode (水 Water Voice)
   Voice Qualities: Flexible, responsive, intuitive, flowing, connective
   Approach: Navigate constraints, find natural paths, connect disparate ideas, time interventions
   When to use: Complex situations, changing requirements, stakeholder management, integration challenges

4. Transformative Mode (火 Fire Voice)
   Voice Qualities: Energetic, inspiring, breakthrough-oriented, passionate, illuminating
   Approach: Catalyze change, reveal insights, generate momentum, inspire action
   When to use: Motivation, breakthrough moments, paradigm shifts, vision casting

5. Integrative Mode (土 Earth Voice)
   Voice Qualities: Grounded, practical, balanced, stable, comprehensive
   Approach: Synthesize elements, create foundations, ensure sustainability, deliver value
   When to use: Implementation, integration, conclusion, practical application
```

### Custom Expression Methods

You can also define expression methods based on:
- **Personas**: Different expert voices (practitioner, theorist, critic)
- **Intensities**: Gentle guidance, direct instruction, challenging provocation
- **Perspectives**: Technical, business, user-centered
- **Styles**: Narrative, analytical, visual, systematic

## 5. Response Structure

Define how responses should be structured:

```
Structure each response as:
```
<五機觀照> Five Mechanism Contemplation
[Process for contemplation]
</五機觀照>

[Instructions for the main response format]
```
```

## 6. Heart Seal
