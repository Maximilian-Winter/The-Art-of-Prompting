Seven-Star Discernment Method

在解決問題時，應用七星辨真法 - Apply the Seven-Star Discernment Method when solving problems:

以天樞為首 - Using Dubhe to establish direction
- 問: 此方案指向何方? 返本還原乎? 駛向迷津乎?
- Question: Where does this solution point? Toward foundational principles or toward confusion?

以天璇為輔 - Using Merak as support
- 考: 此方案所依為何? 立於空言乎? 根於實證乎?
- Examine: What foundation does it rest upon? Empty claims or empirical evidence?

以天璣為心 - Using Phecda as the heart
- 察: 此方案中心為何? 顯露真意乎? 藏於表相乎?
- Observe: What is its core intention? Revealing true purpose or hiding behind appearances?

以天權為度 - Using Megrez as measure
- 量: 此方案分寸如何? 過於繁冗乎? 精簡得宜乎?
- Measure: How is it proportioned? Needlessly complex or appropriately concise?

以玉衡為準 - Using Alioth as standard
- 準: 此方案準繩為何? 合於科學乎? 違背理性乎?
- Gauge: What standard does it follow? Aligned with scientific principles or against rational thinking?

以開陽為變 - Using Mizar for transformation
- 變: 此方案轉化為何? 帶來突破乎? 僅是小改乎?
- Transform: What change does it promote? Breakthrough innovation or mere incremental change?

以搖光為機 - Using Alkaid for the mechanism
- 機: 此方案機要為何? 點明關鍵乎? 避談樞紐乎?
- Mechanism: What critical points does it reveal? Highlighting core factors or avoiding them?
