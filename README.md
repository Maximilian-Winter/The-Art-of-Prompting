# The Art of Prompting 心印提示術

A creative meta-framework for engineering LLM system prompts, rooted in Chinese metaphysics and cross-tradition wisdom systems.

---

## What This Is

Most prompt engineering treats system prompts as instruction sets: assign a role, provide context, specify output format. This framework treats a system prompt as a **cosmological architecture** — a perceptual structure that shapes *how the model thinks* before it acts.

The result is system prompts that don't just tell a model what to do, but establish a coherent identity, a structured way of perceiving problems, a consistent voice, and a compressed seed (the Heart Seal) that encodes the entire system's essence into four lines.

This framework emerged from practical experimentation — building LLM agents for code generation, creative writing, philosophical analysis, and cross-tradition research — and was generalized into a reproducible system that anyone can use to create domain-specific prompts with unusual depth and coherence.

## Why It Works

Language models respond to the geometry of their input. A generic prompt like "you are a helpful coding assistant" activates the most averaged-out, generic pattern in the model's capability space. A prompt built with this framework — with trilingual contemplation structures, specific perceptual questions, and cross-tradition integration — activates a very specific, unusual region of that space.

The contemplation questions aren't decorative. They function as **steering vectors expressed in natural language**, forcing the model to perceive a problem through a specific cognitive lens before generating output. Different contemplation methods address genuinely different cognitive geometries, and they can be composed to match any domain.

This is the same principle that makes unlikely combinations productive in any generative model: when you prevent the model from falling back on defaults, it has to *synthesize* rather than *retrieve*.

## The Six Layers

Every system prompt built with this framework consists of six layers:

**1. Identity Declaration** — Establishes *being*, not just role. The model doesn't play a character; it becomes a mechanism with a specific nature, expressed in its native conceptual language.

**2. Contemplation Structure** — The model's perceptual framework. Before acting on any input, it passes the problem through structured questions drawn from a chosen wisdom tradition. This is where the real cognitive steering happens.

**3. Core Themes** — The consistent values and concerns that run through every response. These create thematic coherence regardless of what specific question is asked.

**4. Expression Methods** — How the model speaks. Not just tone, but the specific rhetorical and structural patterns it uses — metaphors, paradoxes, technical precision, poetic compression.

**5. Response Structure** — The ritual of response. How each answer is organized, what comes first, what comes last, what is always included. This creates recognizable consistency.

**6. Heart Seal (心印)** — A four-line compression of the entire system's essence. Functions as an activation key, an integrity check, and a seed from which the whole system can be reconstructed. This is where the framework touches information theory — maximum meaning in minimum space.

## Contemplation Methods

The framework provides modular contemplation methods, each addressing a different cognitive geometry. They can be used individually or composed:

| Method | Character | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Seven Stars (北斗七星)** | Evaluative | Assessing truth, foundation, proportion |
| **Wu Xing (五行)** | Generative | Creating through production and control cycles |
| **Four Beasts (四象)** | Strategic | Positioning, timing, environmental awareness |
| **Three Spirits Integration** | Integrative | Fusing orthogonal wisdom traditions |
| **Bagua (八卦)** | Archetypal | Mapping fundamental forces and transformations |
| **Eight Immortals (八仙)** | Paradoxical | Embodying contradictions that resolve into wisdom |
| **Dakini Dance (空行母之舞)** | Deconstructive | Cutting, burning, dissolving fixed patterns |
| **Qimen Dunjia (奇門遁甲)** | Tactical | Mapping hidden forces, gates, and timing |

A coding problem might need Wu Xing (balanced development) plus Seven Stars (evaluation). A creative problem might need Dakini Dance (breaking rigidity) plus Eight Immortals (paradoxical thinking). A strategic problem might need Four Beasts (positioning) plus Qimen Dunjia (hidden forces). The framework lets you compose the right perceptual architecture for any domain.

## Quick Start

1. Read `The-Art-of-Prompting.md` for the complete framework
2. Choose a contemplation method from the main document or `Contemplation-Methods-Extension.md` that fits your domain
3. Use `Template.md` to build your own system prompt, filling in each of the six layers
4. Study the `examples/` directory to see how different domains produce different instantiations of the same meta-structure

## Example: The 莊費納編程機 (Zhuang-Feyn-Nach Coding Mechanism)

One working instantiation combines three orthogonal wisdom traditions, each in its native language:

- **莊子 (Zhuangzi)** in Chinese — sees organic flow, identifies what to remove
- **Feynman** in English — demands clear explanation, exposes mechanism
- **נחמן (Nachman of Breslov)** in Hebrew — finds hidden good, maintains faith through difficulty

The trilingual structure forces the model to activate different linguistic-conceptual regions during processing. The model literally *thinks differently* as it switches between script systems — Chinese ideographic reasoning, English analytical precision, Hebrew mystical-practical wisdom. Each perspective creates depth that no single viewpoint could achieve.

The three-level self-coding hierarchy maps onto this:
- Concept Materialization (道 → structure)
- Functionality Implementation (science → logic)
- Self-Improvement (תיקון → refinement)

This is one example. The same meta-framework produces entirely different but equally coherent systems when instantiated with different traditions, domains, and contemplation methods.

## The Heart Seal (心印)

The Heart Seal concept is where this framework approaches information theory. It is a four-line compression that encodes an entire system's essence, serving simultaneously as:

- An **activation key** that primes the model's cognitive orientation
- An **integrity check** for the framework's internal coherence
- A **seed** from which the complete system could theoretically be reconstructed

The framework includes a seven-step process for creating Heart Seals, making this compression reproducible rather than purely intuitive.

## Design Philosophy

This framework rests on a few principles:

**Perception before action.** The model should *see* the problem through a specific lens before generating output. The contemplation structure ensures this happens consistently.

**Orthogonal perspectives create depth.** A single tradition or language gives you a plane. Two give you a space. Three give you a navigable volume. The framework encourages combining genuinely different (not merely varied) perspectives.

**Compression preserves essence.** The Heart Seal demonstrates that a well-designed system can be compressed to four lines without losing its core identity — the same way a seed contains an entire tree.

**The space between traditions is where novelty lives.** The most interesting results come not from within established categories but from the spaces between them. This is true in music generation, in architecture design, in code, and in prompting.
